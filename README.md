## Overview

We are living in the era of Smart cities where everything is planned and systematic. The problem we are facing is of the population, which is rising rapidly. In recent years, urban migration has skyrocketed. This has resulted in the rise of garbage waste everywhere. Dumping of garbage in public places creates a polluted environment in the neighborhood. It could cause a number of serious diseases to the people living around. This will embarrass the evaluation of the affected area. In order to reduce waste and maintain good hygiene, we need a systematic approach to tackle the problem.  The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a complex, cumbersome process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which is not compatible with the present day technologies in any way. We propose a solution to this waste problem which manages the garbage waste smartly. This research paper proposes an IoT based smart system based on clean waste management that assesses the level of waste on dustbins through sensory systems. In this system the microcontroller is used as a visual connector connecting sensor and the IoT system. This an advanced method in which waste management is automated. This project IoT Garbage Monitoring system is a very innovative system which will help to keep the cities clean. This system monitors the garbage bins and informs about the level of garbage collected in the garbage bins via a web page. This web page also send all information to garbage collection vehicles.
